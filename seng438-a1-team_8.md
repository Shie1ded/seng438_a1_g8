# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing allows the tester to be flexible and creative when designing test cases, as there is no strict plan required to create them, and are designed and executed simultaenously. This testing is ultimately up to the tester to create "realistic" scenarios that will cause the system under test to either pass or fail. Exploratory testing is efficient and fast at finding critical defects because it has less overhead, as the tester can start testing without writing detailed test specifications. In addition, since there is minimal need for planning and processing, testers can use exploratory testing at any step of the software development life cycle.

During our exploratory testing, the benefit we noticed was that at the end of this phase, we had a wide variety of test cases. Due to test cases being designed based on an individual's knowledge and personal experience, we could view the ATM system with different perspectives. For example, although we had several overlapping test cases, group 1 found that the ATM system still accepts a card that had been retained due to entering an incorrect PIN three times, while group 2 missed this defect in their test suite. Therefore, allowing us to find more and possibly uncommon defects in the system.  

However, a trade-off with exploratory testing is that it is more difficult to keep track of the tests performed. For example, during exploratory testing, we tested different functions in a random order, and there were times when we had to re-test them because we were unsure if we properly tested them the first time. Moreover, without in-depth domain knowledge of the system, there is a higher chance of missing critical defects as there is little documentation on what the system expects. For example, there was a misunderstanding of what the "available balance" should be after a transaction, as it was not documented clearly. 


-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
