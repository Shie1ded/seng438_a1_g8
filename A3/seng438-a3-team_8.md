1. Introduction

2. Manual data-flow coverage calculations for 'calculateColumnTotal' and 'Intersects' methods

3. A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

4. A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

5. A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

6. Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

7. A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

8. A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

9. Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

10. Comments/feedback on the lab itself
